I hope I stop having nightmares about trying to maneuver around public transit, taking buses anxious trying to catch trains that are always just about to leave... I hate it @goldietaylor @cee_pain Black folks are more likely to work in jobs that can’t be done remotely (or at places that won’t allow it &amp; don’t follow safety rules on-site) and more likely to need public transit.

If not, there’s PA. @odachrome @Jamesonhhcc @alexmadsen00 @FayeJarrah @subsonicwardrum @DaShaunLH @thinglygrammar There’s no public transit, and all markets in poor neighborhoods only carry junk food? ? Where are people buying their TP, soap and laundry supplies from then? And the infrastructure hits just keep on coming. #TaxTheRich #waleg and invest in public transit, public schools, bridges, broadband, and affordable housing. https://t.co/KurWBgZKAl Really enjoyed participating in the @NEWaukee Urban Spaceship Conference today. Our group presented on the State of Public Transit. What is the future of transportation and planning? Well you\\'re looking at it right here. Representation absolutely matters. https://t.co/dKTTvWOEAa Sweetheart you\\'re sadly mistaken. Watch this TikTok girl. Go watch a few of these. Shes showing you that 100s of black cities &amp; neighborhoods have no type of market what so ever. No drive no walk no public transit. Black communities have McDonalds fast food &amp; dollar stores ONLY. https://t.co/8gSRrR3y1D @kyliedoesntknow @CoalSlah Yes! Way back when I was considering colleges before Covid one of the things I looked at was public transit access 😂 This is really bad... \\n\\n🚇 Subway closure at 12\\n🚊 No weekend commuter rail\\n🚌 Less frequent bus and subway service... \\n\\nThe negative impacts of these public transit service cuts will be felt by everyone, for a long time, whether you use public transit or not. https://t.co/wL4mJQQ7oD Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods are 14-15 minutes driving and almost an hour by public transit https://t.co/EA4D4c1sFR @MBTA some commuters like me have medical conditions which don\\'t *allow* us to drive, so we RELY on public transit. Don\\'t leave us behind! #TransitIsEssential https://t.co/wE2FQBHoyn Public transit is an essential service. Not everyone owns a car or can afford to park in Boston. Also ... Emissions. Now is not the time to cut back. https://t.co/ywtwleeY79'"

       "'update its public now the  transit plan process has been pausedsocial distancing will stay at  amp service will be increased on routes where people have been passed up so basically they are doing what we asked them to do    theres always public transit covid impacts on public transit  gm tells me they are losing  million a day she says depending on what state and local funders decide in budget talks—and if they do not get any federal relief—cuts to service amp potential layoffs are possible  at   frustrating that the approval was denied based almost solely on concerns about parking and traffic your suggestions about including pedestrianbikepublic transit data in their proposal was really valid and im miffed it got brushed aside so easily googlemaps publictransportation tech google maps now shows how crowded your train or bus is in realtime    way to broad a statement we should focus on encouraging people to wear a mask indoors on public transit amp when they cannot socially distance sneering at someone that doesnt wear a mask outdoors while walking running or cycling is counterproductive transit oriented development tod was a major topic of discussion throughout my campaign residents throughout ward  expressed a desire for  to focus new housing growth along transit corridors where there is easy access to public transit amenities and services a progressive future plan requires the need for effective public transit  check out this article from jackson suncity leaders waiting on a plan from jackson transit authority after it received millions of dollars from the cares act  working maintenance with public transit trains people automatically assume that we know the travel schedule of most of the trains as they come on another note it looks like texas needs to work on its public transit                       my husband works for public transit and people leave them on the bus at the stops on the benches and on the ground public transit should be accessible for all including bike shares to give people opportunities to participate in alternative modes of transportation the long waited  expansion in astoria sunnyside and woodside is here join the virtual town hall   link below  if jobs with titles like security officerpublic transit sound appealing to you follow us to hear about these types of opportunities in phoenix az securityofficer securityguard too scared to go to campus now bc people on public transit still wont wear their masks when every  out of  ppl have covid in chicago rn what the fuck give us money and shut everything down thanks to state delegate jared solomon for sharing his thoughts about state of maryland transportation issues with committee for montgomery hes helped us understand critical issues about public private partnerships pedestrian safety marc public transit and state funding it frustrates me how public transit is made with only able bodied people in mind honesty i miss public transit and bars more than anything so probably take the bus to go get drinks  ill never forget when karen said the chambers big  transportation initiative should focus on job access via public transit one of my local heroes   perks of nyc living atlanta is so behind on public transit im afraid   admittedly dc metro pre covid was heads and shoulders above most public transit in the us but certainly had its problems lol running on investing in urbanism  for better jobs cheaper housing good public schools reliable transit competent public health  safety greater sustainability  is a winning appeal to voters in cities and in suburbs  as a carless person i find  often inaccurate but the public transit discrepancies noted in this thread are inexcusable httpstcotikqgfruob cant believe someone tweeted saying theyre angry that aoc has a car and is driving instead of taking public transit and she had to reply saying basically hi theres covid and also people literally want to kill me  if you think about covid and how people in higher paying jobs have the flexibility amp technology to work remotely while others with low paying wage work are forced into long public transit commutes and interactions herd immunity is going to devastate the working class when i ride public transit i think about making fun of trent in new ways and a huge grin spreads across my face then i reach my destination i hope i stop having nightmares about trying to maneuver around public transit taking buses anxious trying to catch trains that are always just about to leave i hate it   black folks are more likely to work in jobs that cant be done remotely or at places that wont allow it amp dont follow safety rules onsite and more likely to need public transit thus blacks are more likely to be the essential workers keeping everyone else safe i love when cities have legit public transit  public transit never forget it public bathrooms are as hazardous as you can get in my view i canceled a summer trip to durango after i had friends who are confident a public bathroom in transit is where  hitboth in different states no other public interaction bathrooms are terrible  widening of  as in these designs would represent a generational failure one your children will likely spend billions tearing out and replacing  project connects ambitious public transit plan the difference is only a lack of vision   made specific transit accommodations for the   arena with zero parking im curious if we are all cool with public transit hooked directly up to super spreader events next door to the  and  hospitals a progressive income tax abolition of child labor universal education and nationalized public transit sounds great thanks tim    shes not serious about covid if she was she would shut down public transit do something about the homeless without masks and the peaceful protesters  without masks  welcome to public transit andbasically discount short distance greyhound 😂 this is what gets metros juices flowing they just want to play in the dirt with big toys perhaps los angeles needs to find someone else to operate a reliable mass transit system that serves the needs of the public who wants to name the bus that runs on time   its insaneon wednesday i took public transit bus amp train like l train into center city to participate in medical researchi havent done anything like that in  months no no no we seriously cant let state dots and existing formulas dictate transportation planning their answer is always highway expansion  road repair they are not designed to think in terms of public transit accessibility or sustainability this would be a huge mistake    we  need a comprehensive vision that gets us to  million new units of affordable housing and the transitschoolpublic spacesanitation infrastructure to support it within  minutes on foot  amazing local coffeeshops  local grocery stores  coop and  asian  beautiful parks vet for fur babies library many small local restaurants public transit downtown seattle  min ride airport  min my doctor  stop     then why do they lower the persons social score which can cost them current job ability to use public transit ect starting now join the zoom and urge the vta pac to recommend  service for full info and talking points please speak on item   transit plan not general public comment at the beginning httpstcoctwdzcjebc public transit free please see also  public transit ridership trends  im mostly joking the real crime is the job that requires me to use public transit five days a week during a

httpstcojgjtqoqwpr starting now join the zoom and urge the vta ctma to recommend  service for full info and talking points please speak on item   transit plan not general public comment at the beginning  we will get through this transit riders make sure to continue to follow all signs amp regulations when riding public transit and try to be flexible and patient it is not fun to be passed up by a full bus but it is much less fun to get   bus transit  refusal to wear a mask in a public setting puts others at risk of illness or death its that simpleif you arent going to wear one please stay out of our transit system   its an outdoor scene though and not crowded masks would make little difference how about on public transit there  also improving public transit is a great way to cut down on duis because it provides a better alternative to driving   ill take dedicated bus lanes any day every transit project starts out small dont judge the potential on the first delivery the mbta fiscal management and control board mostly appointed by  says its slashing public transit service for the sake of social equity but thats not equity its doubling down on austerity we need to taxtherich and freethet httpstcoyiwdmhqxdb  if you and  ever consider spending an anniversary trip in europe i highly recommend london their public transit is on point never waited longer than  minutes for a train or bus to get around the city makes wmata look like a joke 😂 public transit service disruptions  lack of public transit the leading cause of impaired driving  public transit    this is atlanta unfortunately the people need to feel more exclusive and high classthey wont touch the marta busbut theyll happily jump on the shuttlelolwhatever they need to feel good about public transit im for it public transit enables stronger and healthier communities by providing access to healthcare and removing single occupancy vehicles from the roads  predators everywhere n they wonder y ion use public transit nomo 😒🙄😒 ridiculously disgusting 🤢🤬  grandfather clock dildo talk while on public transit uh these are my friend so  we need a full lockdown pay people to stay home drastically ramp up testing and contact testing radically invest in infrastructure for touchless engagement in public transit etc etc i dont see anyone discussing this as an option it is the option the other option is death  thats what i was wondering  if the contact tracers are leading the positive person to come up with the answers they want as many have noted school and public transit seem to be magical         when will the city begin enforcement of bus lanes again  bus lanes throughout city are impossible those still using public transit should have an advantage  starting now join the zoom and urge the vta cac

station and weekend commuter rail service many ward  residents rely on public transit as do customers and employees of our main street local businesses  this is the dumbest shit ive ever seen of
